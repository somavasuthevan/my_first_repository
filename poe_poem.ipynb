    "Challenge yourself with this exercise...below is the following Edgar Allen Poe poem. It is a Valentine poem secretly written to a specific woman who's name is hidden in the poem. Specifically, it is a [acrostic poem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrostic) where if you take from line number `x`, letter number `x`, and piece it together it will spell the name. So take the first letter from the first line, second letter from the second line...use Python to discover the secret.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Hint: Use a sting method to break the string into individual lines. Try `.splitlines`\n",
    "- Next hint...given a line how to you pull out the correct letter? Avoiding puctuation and spacing is an issue here."
